# Structured v0.1
A JS game framework that is entirely functional and is meant to replace a bad game engine (no names).  
  
Code design heavily inspired by Flutter.  
  
This is SUPER early into development so don't use this in a professional setting.  
  
Make sure you have express and nodejs, run this program by typing: `node run.js`.

This repo probaly has a ton of errors to please make sure to report issues when you see them.
